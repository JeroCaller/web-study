                    is a language that defines a fundamental structure of web page. 
                    All web sites are written in HTML, and web browser interprets their 
                    documents to show users the web pages visually. 
                    HTML consists of element and attribute. Element defines the structure of 
                    web pages, and attribute specifies a property of elements. 
                    for example, "&lt;h1&gt;" is a element representing heading, and 
                    "&lt;img&gt;" is a element to show images. 
                    We can design the layout of web page by combining these elements. 
                    </p>

                <div class="g-article">
                    <p>
                    HTML also provides a function to create hyperlink. You can do it by using 
                    the element "&lt;a&gt;" to direct other web pages so that visiters can move 
                    across the web sites. 
                    HTML is a starting point to develop web and able to combine another 
                    web technologies to make web pages dynamic and interactive. 
                    You can use CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) to decorate web and 
                    JavaScript to add some dynamic functions to the web. 
                    Web developers can make user-friendly web pages and 
                    deliver information to users effectively by HTML. 
                    HTML has simple syntax and flexibility so that anyone can develop web with it.
