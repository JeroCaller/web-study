        is a language that defines a fundamental structure of web page. 
        All web sites are written in HTML, and web browser interprets their 
        documents to show users the web pages visually. 
        HTML consists of element and attribute. Element defines the structure of 
        web pages, and attribute specifies a property of elements. 
        for example, "&lt;h1&gt;" is a element representing heading, and 
        "&lt;img&gt;" is a element to show images. 
        We can design the layout of web page by combining these elements. 
        HTML also provides a function to create hyperlink. You can do it by using 
        the element "&lt;a&gt;" to direct other web pages so that visiters can move 
        across the web sites. 
        HTML is a starting point to develop web and able to combine another 
        web technologies to make web pages dynamic and interactive. 
        You can use CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) to decorate web and 
        JavaScript to add some dynamic functions to the web. 
        Web developers can make user-friendly web pages and 
        deliver information to users effectively by HTML. 
        HTML has simple syntax and flexibility so that anyone can develop web with it.
